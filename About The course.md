# Two-Pointer-Basic-Algorithm

Aslamualaikum Friends,

-> Welcome to the Two Pointer Course Overview! In this course, we will
   explore the concept of the Two Pointer technique, a powerful algorithmic
   approach used in various programming problems. The Two Pointer technique 
   is especially useful in scenarios where you need to efficiently solve 
   problems involving arrays, strings, or linked lists.

-> Throughout this course, we will cover the fundamental principles behind
   the Two Pointer technique, its applications in different problem domains,
   and various implementation strategies. By the end of this course, you will
   have a solid understanding of how and when to apply the Two Pointer technique
   to solve complex problems effectively.
